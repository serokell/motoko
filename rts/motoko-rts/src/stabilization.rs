//! Graph-copy-based stabilzation on upgrades, serializing the entire stable object graph into
//! stable memory by using a defined long-term stable storage format.
//!
//! Use cases:
//! - Classical model of volatile main memory: Preserve the stable variables and their reachable
//!   objects across upgrades.
//! - New model of enhanced orthogonal persistence: Support upgrades in the presence of complex
//!   main memory layout changes.
//!
//! A memory compatibility check has to be performed before allowing upgrade: This checks whether
//! the stored stable object graph is compatible with the new program version. For this purpose, the
//! type tables are compared, similar to the IDL-subtype check but customized to the allowed implicit
//! conversion with regard to the stable storage format.
//!
//! Versioned stable storage format to permit future evolutions of the format.
//!  
//! See `GraphCopyStabilization.md` for the stable format specification and the employed algorithm.
