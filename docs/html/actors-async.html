<h1 id="actors-and-async-data">Actors and async data</h1>
<p>The programming model of the Internet Computer consists of
memory-isolated canisters communicating by asynchronous message passing
of binary data encoding Candid values. A canister processes its messages
one-at-a-time, preventing race conditions. A canister uses call-backs to
register what needs to be done with the result of any inter-canister
messages it issues.</p>
<p>Motoko abstracts the complexity of the Internet Computer with a well
known, higher-level abstraction: the <em>actor model</em>. Each canister
is represented as a typed actor. The type of an actor lists the messages
it can handle. Each message is abstracted as a typed, asynchronous
function. A translation from actor types to Candid types imposes
structure on the raw binary data of the underlying Internet Computer. An
actor is similar to an object, but is different in that its state is
completely isolated, its interactions with the world are entirely
through asynchronous messaging, and its messages are processed
one-at-a-time, even when issued in parallel by concurrent actors.</p>
<p>In Motoko, sending a message to an actor is a function call, but
instead of blocking the caller until the call has returned, the message
is enqueued on the callee, and a <em>future</em> representing that
pending request immediately returned to the caller. The future is a
placeholder for the eventual result of the request, that the caller can
later query. Between issuing the request, and deciding to wait for the
result, the caller is free to do other work, including issuing more
requests to the same or other actors. Once the callee has processed the
request, the future is completed and its result made available to the
caller. If the caller is waiting on the future, its execution can resume
with the result, otherwise the result is simply stored in the future for
later use.</p>
<p>In Motoko, actors have dedicated syntax and types; messaging is
handled by so called <em>shared</em> functions returning futures (shared
because they are available to remote actors); a future, <code>f</code>,
is a value of the special type <code>async T</code> for some type
<code>T</code>; waiting on <code>f</code> to be completed is expressed
using <code>await f</code> to obtain a value of type <code>T</code>. To
avoid introducing shared state through messaging, for example, by
sending an object or mutable array, the data that can be transmitted
through shared functions is restricted to immutable, <em>shared</em>
types.</p>
<p>To start, we consider the simplest stateful service: a
<code>Counter</code> actor, the distributed version of our previous,
local <code>counter</code> object.</p>
<h2 id="example-a-counter-service">Example: a Counter service</h2>
<p>Consider the following actor declaration:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code></code></pre>
<!--
actor Counter {

  var count = 0;

  public shared func inc() : async () { count += 1 };

  public shared func read() : async Nat { count };

  public shared func bump() : async Nat {
    count += 1;
    count;
  };
};
-->

<p>The <code>Counter</code> actor declares one field and three public,
<em>shared</em> functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the field <code>count</code> is mutable, initialized to zero and
implicitly <code>private</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>function <code>inc()</code> asynchronously increments the counter
and returns a future of type <code>async ()</code> for
synchronization.</p></li>
<li><p>function <code>read()</code> asynchronously reads the counter
value and returns a future of type <code>async Nat</code> containing its
value.</p></li>
<li><p>function <code>bump()</code> asynchronously increments and reads
the counter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Shared functions, unlike local functions, are accessible to remote
callers and have additional restrictions: their arguments and return
value must be <em>shared</em> types - a subset of types that includes
immutable data, actor references, and shared function references, but
excludes references to local functions and mutable data. Because all
interaction with actors is asynchronous, an actorâ€™s functions must
return futures, that is, types of the form <code>async T</code>, for
some type <code>T</code>.</p>
<p>The only way to read or modify the state (<code>count</code>) of the
<code>Counter</code> actor is through its shared functions.</p>
<p>A value of type <code>async T</code> is a future. The producer of the
future completes the future when it returns a result, either a value or
error.</p>
<p>Unlike objects and modules, actors can only expose functions, and
these functions must be <code>shared</code>. For this reason, Motoko
allows you to omit the <code>shared</code> modifier on public actor
functions, allowing the more concise, but equivalent, actor
declaration:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code></code></pre>
<p>For now, the only place shared functions can be declared is in the
body of an actor or actor class. Despite this restriction, shared
functions are still first-class values in Motoko and can be passed as
arguments or results, and stored in data structures.</p>
<p>The type of a shared function is specified using a shared function
type. For example, the value <code>inc</code> has type
<code>shared () â†’ async Nat</code> and could be supplied as a standalone
callback to some other service (see <a
href="sharing.md">publish-subscribe</a> for an example).</p>
<h2 id="actor-types">Actor types</h2>
<p>Just as objects have object types, actors have <em>actor types</em>.
The <code>Counter</code> actor has the following type:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code>actor {
  inc  : shared () -&gt; async ();
  read : shared () -&gt; async Nat;
  bump : shared () -&gt; async Nat;
}</code></pre>
<p>Again, because the <code>shared</code> modifier is required on every
member of an actor, Motoko both elides them on display, and allows you
to omit them when authoring an actor type.</p>
<p>Thus the previous type can be expressed more succinctly as:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code>actor {
  inc  : () -&gt; async ();
  read : () -&gt; async Nat;
  bump : () -&gt; async Nat;
}</code></pre>
<p>Like object types, actor types support subtyping: an actor type is a
subtype of a more general one that offers fewer functions with more
general types.</p>
<h2 id="using-await-to-consume-async-futures">Using <code>await</code>
to consume async futures</h2>
<p>The caller of a shared function typically receives a future, a value
of type <code>async T</code> for some T.</p>
<p>The only thing the caller, a consumer, can do with this future is
wait for it to be completed by the producer, throw it away, or store it
for later use.</p>
<p>To access the result of an <code>async</code> value, the receiver of
the future use an <code>await</code> expression.</p>
<p>For example, to use the result of <code>Counter.read()</code> above,
we can first bind the future to an identifier <code>a</code>, and then
<code>await a</code> to retrieve the underlying <code>Nat</code>,
<code>n</code>:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code>let a : async Nat = Counter.read();
let n : Nat = await a;</code></pre>
<p>The first line immediately receives <em>a future of the counter
value</em>, but does not wait for it, and thus cannot (yet) use it as a
natural number.</p>
<p>The second line <code>await</code>s this future and extracts the
result, a natural number. This line may suspend execution until the
future has been completed.</p>
<p>Typically, one rolls the two steps into one and one just awaits an
asynchronous call directly:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code>let n : Nat = await Counter.read();</code></pre>
<p>Unlike a local function call, which blocks the caller until the
callee has returned a result, a shared function call immediately returns
a future, <code>f</code>, without blocking. Instead of blocking, a later
call to <code>await f</code> suspends the current computation until
<code>f</code> is complete. Once the future is completed (by the
producer), execution of <code>await p</code> resumes with its result. If
the result is a value, <code>await f</code> returns that value.
Otherwise the result is some error, and <code>await f</code> propagates
the error to the consumer of <code>await f</code>.</p>
<p>Awaiting a future a second time will just produce the same result,
including re-throwing any error stored in the future. Suspension occurs
even if the future is already complete; this ensures state changes and
message sends prior to <em>every</em> <code>await</code> are
committed.</p>
<p>:::danger</p>
<p>A function that does not <code>await</code> in its body is guaranteed
to execute atomically - in particular, the environment cannot change the
state of the actor while the function is executing. If a function
performs an <code>await</code>, however, atomicity is no longer
guaranteed. Between suspension and resumption around the
<code>await</code>, the state of the enclosing actor may change due to
concurrent processing of other incoming actor messages. It is the
programmerâ€™s responsibility to guard against non-synchronized state
changes. A programmer may, however, rely on any state change prior to
the await being committed.</p>
<p>:::</p>
<p>For example, the implementation of <code>bump()</code> above is
guaranteed to increment and read the value of <code>count</code>, in one
atomic step. The alternative implementation:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code>  public shared func bump() : async Nat {
    await inc();
    await read();
  };</code></pre>
<p>does <em>not</em> have the same semantics and allows another client
of the actor to interfere with its operation: each <code>await</code>
suspends execution, allowing an interloper to change the state of the
actor. By design, the explicit <code>await</code>s make the potential
points of interference clear to the reader.</p>
<h2 id="traps-and-commit-points">Traps and Commit Points</h2>
<p>A trap is a non-recoverable runtime failure caused by, for example,
division-by-zero, out-of-bounds array indexing, numeric overflow, cycle
exhaustion or assertion failure.</p>
<p>A shared function call that executes without executing an
<code>await</code> expression never suspends and executes atomically. A
shared function that contains no <code>await</code> expression is
syntactically atomic.</p>
<p>An atomic shared function whose execution traps has no visible effect
on the state of the enclosing actor or its environment - any state
change is reverted, and any message that it has sent is revoked. In
fact, all state changes and message sends are tentative during
execution: they are committed only after a successful <em>commit
point</em> is reached.</p>
<p>The points at which tentative state changes and message sends are
irrevocably committed are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>implicit exit from a shared function by producing a
result,</p></li>
<li><p>explict exit via <code>return</code> or <code>throw</code>
expressions, and</p></li>
<li><p>explicit <code>await</code> expressions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A trap will only revoke changes made since the last commit point. In
particular, in a non-atomic function that does multiple awaits, a trap
will only revoke changes attempted since the last await - all preceding
effects will have been committed and cannot be undone.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following (contrived) stateful
<code>Atomicity</code> actor:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code></code></pre>
<p>Calling (shared) function <code>atomic()</code> will fail with an
error, since the last statement causes a trap. However, the trap leaves
the mutable variable <code>s</code> with value <code>0</code>, not
<code>1</code>, and variable <code>pinged</code> with value
<code>false</code>, not <code>true</code>. This is because the trap
happens <em>before</em> method <code>atomic</code> has executed an
<code>await</code>, or exited with a result. Even though
<code>atomic</code> calls <code>ping()</code>, <code>ping()</code> is
tentative (queued) until the next commit point, so never delivered.</p>
<p>Calling (shared) function <code>nonAtomic()</code> will fail with an
error, since the last statement causes a trap. However, the trap leaves
the variable <code>s</code> with value <code>3</code>, not
<code>0</code>, and variable <code>pinged</code> with value
<code>true</code>, not <code>false</code>. This is because each
<code>await</code> commits its preceding side-effects, including message
sends. Even though <code>f</code> is complete by the second await on
<code>f</code>, this await also forces a commit of the state, suspends
execution and allows for interleaved processing of other messages to
this actor.</p>
<h2 id="query-functions">Query functions</h2>
<p>In Internet Computer terminology, all three <code>Counter</code>
functions are <em>update</em> messages that can alter the state of the
canister when called. Effecting a state change requires agreement
amongst the distributed replicas before the Internet Computer can commit
the change and return a result. Reaching consensus is an expensive
process with relatively high latency.</p>
<p>For the parts of applications that donâ€™t require the guarantees of
consensus, the Internet Computer supports more efficient <em>query</em>
operations. These are able to read the state of a canister from a single
replica, modify a snapshot during their execution and return a result,
but cannot permanently alter the state or send further Internet Computer
messages.</p>
<p>Motoko supports the implementation of Internet Computer queries using
<code>query</code> functions. The <code>query</code> keyword modifies
the declaration of a (shared) actor function so that it executes with
non-committing, and faster, Internet Computer query semantics.</p>
<p>For example, we can extend the <code>Counter</code> actor with a
fast-and-loose variant of the trustworthy <code>read</code> function,
called <code>peek</code>:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code></code></pre>
<p>The <code>peek()</code> function might be used by a
<code>Counter</code> frontend offering a quick, but less trustworthy,
display of the current counter value.</p>
<p>It is a compile-time error for a query method to call an actor
function since this would violate dynamic restrictions imposed by the
Internet Computer. Calls to ordinary functions are permitted.</p>
<p>Query functions can be called from non-query functions. Because those
nested calls require consensus, the efficiency gains of nested query
calls will be modest at best.</p>
<p>The <code>query</code> modifier is reflected in the type of a query
function:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code>  peek : shared query () -&gt; async Nat</code></pre>
<p>As before, in <code>query</code> declarations and actor types the
<code>shared</code> keyword can be omitted.</p>
<h2 id="messaging-restrictions">Messaging restrictions</h2>
<p>The Internet Computer places restrictions on when and how canisters
are allowed to communicate. These restrictions are enforced dynamically
on the Internet Computer but prevented statically in Motoko, ruling out
a class of dynamic execution errors. Two examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>canister installation can execute code, but not send
messages.</p></li>
<li><p>a canister query method cannot send messages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These restrictions are surfaced in Motoko as restrictions on the
context in which certain expressions can be used.</p>
<p>In Motoko, an expression occurs in an <em>asynchronous context</em>
if it appears in the body of an <code>async</code> expression, which may
be the body of a (shared or local) function or a stand-alone expression.
The only exception are <code>query</code> functions, whose body is not
considered to open an asynchronous context.</p>
<p>In Motoko calling a shared function is an error unless the function
is called in an asynchronous context. In addition, calling a shared
function from an actor class constructor is also an error.</p>
<p>The <code>await</code> construct is only allowed in an asynchronous
context.</p>
<p>The <code>async</code> construct is only allowed in an asynchronous
context.</p>
<p>It is only possible to <code>throw</code> or <code>try/catch</code>
errors in an asynchronous context. This is because structured error
handling is supported for messaging errors only and, like messaging
itself, confined to asynchronous contexts.</p>
<p>These rules also mean that local functions cannot, in general,
directly call shared functions or <code>await</code> futures. This
limitation can sometimes be awkward: we hope to extend the type system
to be more permissive in future.</p>

TODO: scoped awaits (if at all)
-->

<h2 id="actor-classes-generalize-actors">Actor classes generalize
actors</h2>
<p>An actor <em>class</em> generalizes a single actor declaration to the
declaration of family of actors satisfying the same interface. An actor
class declares a type, naming the interface of its actors, and a
function that constructs a fresh actor of that type each time it is
supplied with an argument. An actor class thus serves as a factory for
manufacturing actors. Because canister installation is asynchronous on
the Internet Computer, the constructor function is asynchronous too, and
returns its actor in a future.</p>
<p>For example, we can generalize <code>Counter</code> given above to
<code>Counter(init)</code> below, by introducing a constructor
parameter, variable <code>init</code> of type <code>Nat</code>:</p>
<p><code>Counters.mo</code>:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code></code></pre>
<p>If this class is stored in file <code>Counters.mo</code>, then we can
import the file as a module and use it to create several actors with
different initial values:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code>import Counters &quot;Counters&quot;;

let C1 = await Counters.Counter(1);
let C2 = await Counters.Counter(2);
(await C1.read(), await C2.read())</code></pre>
<p>The last two lines above <em>instantiate</em> the actor class twice.
The first invocation uses the initial value <code>1</code>, where the
second uses initial value <code>2</code>. Because actor class
instantiation is asynchronous, each call to <code>Counter(init)</code>
returns a future that can be <code>await</code>ed for the resulting
actor value. Both <code>C1</code> and <code>C2</code> have the same
type, <code>Counters.Counter</code> and can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>:::note</p>
<p>For now, the Motoko compiler gives an error when compiling programs
that do not consist of a single actor or actor class. Compiled programs
may still, however, reference imported actor classes. For more
information, see <a
href="modules-and-imports.md#importing-actor-classes">Importing actor
classes</a> and <a href="actor-classes.md#actor-classes">Actor
classes</a>.</p>
<p>:::</p>
<h2 id="composite-query-functions">Composite query functions</h2>
<p>Although queries can be fast, when called from a frontend, yet
trusted though slower, when called from an actor, they are also limited
in what they can do. In particular, they cannot themselves issue further
messages, including queries.</p>
<p>To address this limitation, the Internet Computer supports another
flavour of query function called a <em>composite query</em>. Like plain
queries, the state changes made by a composite query are transient,
isolated and never committed. Moreover, composite queries cannot call
update functions, including those implicit in <code>async</code>
expressions (which require update calls under the hood). Unlike plain
queries, composite queries can call query functions and composite query
functions, on the same and other actors, but only provided those actors
reside on the same subnet.</p>
<p>As a contrived example, consider generalising the previous
<code>Counter</code> actor to a class of counters. Each instance of the
class provides an additional <code>composite query</code> to sum the
values of a given array of counters:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code></code></pre>
<p>Declaring <code>sum</code> as a <code>composite query</code> enables
it call the <code>peek</code> queries of its argument counters.</p>
<p>While <em>update</em> message can call plain query functions, they
cannot call <em>composite</em> query functions. This distinction, which
is dictated by the current capabilites of the IC, explains why query
functions and composite query functions are regarded as distinct types
of shared functions.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>composite query</code> modifier is reflected in
the type of a composite query function:</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code>  sum : shared composite query ([Counter]) -&gt; async Nat</code></pre>
<p>Since only a composite query can call another composite query, you
may be wondering how any composite query gets called at all? The answer
to this chicken-and-egg problem is that composite queries are initiated
outside the IC, typically by an application (such as a browser frontend)
sending an ingress message invoking a composite query on a backend actor
on the IC.</p>
<p>:::danger</p>
<p>The Internet Computer's semantics of composite queries, like queries,
ensures that state changes made by a composite query are isolated from
other inter-canister calls, including recursive queries, composite or
not, to the same actor.</p>
<p>In particular, like a query, a composite query call rolls back its
state on function exit, but is also does not pass state changes to
sub-query or sub-composite-query calls. Therefore, repeated calls (which
includes recursive calls) have different semantics from the more
familiar sequential calls that accumulate state changes.</p>
<p>In sequential calls to queries made by a composite query, the
internal state changes of preceeding queries will have no effect on
subsequent queries, nor will the queries observe any local state changes
made by the enclosing composite query. Local states changes made by the
composite query are, however, preserved across the calls until finally
being rolled-back on exit from the composite query.</p>
<p>This semantics can lead to surprising behaviour for users accustomed
to ordinary imperative programming.</p>
<p>Consider this contrived example containing the composite query
<code>test</code> that calls query <code>q</code> and composite query
<code>cq</code>.</p>
<pre class="motoko"><code></code></pre>
<p>When <code>state</code> is <code>0</code>, a call to
<code>test</code> returns</p>
<pre><code>{s0 = 0; s1 = 0; s2 = 0; s3 = 3_000}</code></pre>
<p>because none of the local updates to <code>state</code> are visible
to any of the callers or callees.</p>
