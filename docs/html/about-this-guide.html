<h1 id="motoko-programming-language-guide">Motoko Programming Language
Guide</h1>
<h2 id="about-this-guide">About this guide</h2>
<p>The <em>Motoko Programming Language Guide</em> introduces key
features of the general-purpose Motoko programming language and provides
examples and reference information to help you learn the nuances of the
language and the practical implications of how to apply it.</p>
<p>The Motoko programming language is optimized for developing programs
that run on the Internet Computer blockchain network and to work with
the <a
href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install">IC
SDK</a>. You could, in principle, also write programs using Motoko for
more traditional platforms and to run in other contexts, though support
for this is currently best-effort and incomplete. This guide attempts to
strike a balance between highlighting features that are uniquely suited
to running on the Internet Computer and features that are
generally-applicable or well-suited for programs running on all
targets.</p>
<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h2>
<p>This guide provides reference information and examples for
programmers who want to explore or plan to use the Motoko programming
language. Most of the information in this guide is applicable
independent of whether you are developing programs to run on the
Internet Computer or working with the <a
href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install">IC
SDK</a>.</p>
<p>The guide assumes you are familiar with basic programming principles
and terminology and have at least some experience writing programs in a
high-level programming language such as C++ or Rust, or have practical
experience working with a scripting language such as JavaScript or
TypeScript. In addition, Motoko incorporates some aspects of functional
programming, so you might find some knowledge of functional programming
design principles helpful in learning to use Motoko.</p>
<p>Although this guide is intended to help readers from different
backgrounds understand the basic design principles and semantics of the
Motoko, you should keep in mind that the language implementation and the
documentation are also continuing to evolve.</p>
<h2 id="using-this-guide">Using this guide</h2>
<p>To provide a framework for learning Motoko, you might want to start
by reviewing <a href="#engineering-values-and-goals">Engineering values
and goals</a>. The <a href="#engineering-values-and-goals">Engineering
values and goals</a> describe the core design considerations for the
development and evolution of the Motoko programming language.</p>
<p>With those considerations in mind, you can start to explore
fundamental concepts, including the role of types and type annotations,
in simple code examples and small programs.</p>
<p>Once you are familiar with the basic concepts and terminology, later
sections introduce programs that compute in more interesting ways,
including function abstractions, user-defined type definitions,
user-defined actors, and asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>As you begin using Motoko to write your own programs, you can return
to this guide for reference information and examples.</p>
<p>Most of the code examples in this guide are interactive: you can live
edit the example, interpret the code in the browser and see the result.
The interpreter is provided for education purposes. While most of the
language features are supported in the interpreter, they are not exactly
the same as the real compiler. For example, you may get a stack overflow
for a medium-size input, while the real compiler handles the input just
fine. Some of the system features are not fully supported, such as
cycles, canister imports and state-mutating query calls.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-conventions">Documentation conventions</h2>
<p>The following conventions are used in this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Fixed-width</code> font is used for sample code, program
names, program output, file names, and commands that you type at the
command line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bold</strong> text is used to emphasize commands,
buttons, or user interface text, and to introduce new terms.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Italics</em> are used for book titles and to emphasize
specific words or terms.</p></li>
<li><p>The CAUTION style is used to indicate content that is missing or
incomplete.</p></li>
<li><p>The WARNING style is used to indicate where content is outdated
or potentially inaccurate.</p></li>
<li><p>The NOTE style is used to indicate content that describes a
feature that is not yet supported but is planned for a future
release.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="engineering-values-and-goals">Engineering values and goals</h2>
<p>The engineering effort behind the design and implementation of Motoko
is driven by a core set of values and goals. The DFINITY engineering
organization uses these values and goals to define and prioritize the
language features and enhancements to add and improve as part of
<em>ongoing</em> language development.</p>
<p>For transparency into the principles that guide the engineering
effort, the engineering organization has identified the following sets
of core values and secondary values for driving the direction of the
Motoko programming language.</p>
<h3 id="core-values">Core values</h3>
<p>The following guiding principles represent the core values of the
engineering organization in prioritized order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Seamless integration with the Internet Computer blockchain
network to ensure that Motoko provides full language support for the
actor-based model, asynchronous messaging, data persistence, interface
description language interoperability, and other features.</p></li>
<li><p>Ergonomics to ensure that Motoko embraces familiarity,
simplicity, clarity, explicitness, and other human factors.</p></li>
<li><p>Formal correctness to ensure that Motoko maintains state
isolation, a sound type system and type safety, precision, pattern
matching, appropriate defaults, and coding best-practices.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="secondary-values">Secondary values</h3>
<p>The following principles represent the secondary values of the
engineering organization that are deemed important but not primary
driving factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Expressiveness, so that Motoko provides first-class functions,
polymorphism, pattern matching, and more as the language
evolves.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance, so that Motoko provides reasonably fast operation
initially and continues to improves as the language evolves.</p></li>
<li><p>Readiness, so the Motoko comes with "batteries included" in the
form of libraries and examples and out-of-the-box integration with the
<a
href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install">IC
SDK</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="non-goals">Non-goals</h3>
<p>As a counterpoint to the core values and goals, the engineering
organization also identified the following as "non-goals" that are
outside of the scope of the engineering effort:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Having a more advanced type system, with cutting-edge
features.</p></li>
<li><p>Simplicity over functionality in design or implementation (the
"Worse is Better" approach).</p></li>
<li><p>Interoperability or support for running Motoko programs on
blockchains other than the Internet Computer.</p></li>
</ol>

managing canisters, see the <a
