migration-warn.mo:4.7-8.5: warning [M0206], migration expression consumes field `data` of type
  Nat
but does not produce it, yet the field is declared in the actor.

If reinitialization is unintended, and you want to preserve the consumed value, either remove this field from the parameter of the migration function or add it to the result of the migration function.
